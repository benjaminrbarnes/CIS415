As far as the state of my solution, everything is working (I think?). I was
having a lot of problems freeing things initially when resizing
but I was eventually able to get it to work correctly. When I run
valgrind, I get the expected output and have no errors or memory leaks.
I remember hearing Prof. Sventek say that we might want to make our hash tables
do something more than double each time the resize is called, so I added a
#define SCALEFACTOR which one can change to whatever they want to scale the hash
map by. Hopefully I didn't miss anything!

Best,
