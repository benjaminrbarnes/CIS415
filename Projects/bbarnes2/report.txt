NOTE: Because I don't want my part 4 spamming you (as I dont know how correctly it works by your standards), to make my
project print status out to you, you will need to uncomment line 294, where "get_pid_info()" is called. Thanks for understanding!



My project is complete up to part 4ish. Parts 1-3 should work for sure, but I feel that part 4 might not be complete by your standards.
For part 4, I made a function called get_pid_info which is called right after a process is started. It reports the name,
status, bytes read, and bytes written from memory. It will print these out using p1putstr. The printing can be messy, as it can
get intertwined with the potential output of programs executing.

Also, compiling my code right now with 'make' will get you two warning about strcat and sprintf (convert ints to chars) but even
with the warnings it seems to run just fine. I have commented out the stdio.h and string.h headers as we aren't allowed to use them,
but uncommenting them will get rid of those two warnings. As I said, the code runs for me on the VM without the imports present.
I used the same flags in my make file as the ones given to us.

Hopefully I didn't miss anything!

Best,
